🚗 Ford Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the price of Ford cars based on various features such as model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, MPG, and engine size. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms to estimate the resale value of Ford vehicles accurately.

📌 Project Overview

Car price prediction is a regression problem in machine learning. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the selling price of a Ford car based on its specifications.

* This project includes:

* Data preprocessing

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Feature engineering

* Model training

* Model evaluation

* Price prediction


  📊 Dataset Features
